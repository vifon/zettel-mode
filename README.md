zettel-mode [name subject to change]
====================================

An opinionated Emacs mode for [Zettelkasten][1]-style note-taking.
Heavily inspired by [org-roam][2], striving to be simpler, less
dependent on the external state (like the auxiliary database of
`org-roam`) and local only to the affected files (i.e. no global minor
modes).

ASSUMPTIONS
-----------

Traditionally uses [Deft][3] as its "entry point" and was initially
developed under an assumption the `Deft` files reside in `~/.deft/`.
It should work with any `deft-directory` but you'll need to customize
`auto-mode-alist` accordingly.  Using subdirectories isn't supported.

It's possible to have secondary Zettelkastens outside of `~/.deft/`,
or ignore Deft whatsoever by handling `auto-mode-alist` manually, for example:

```elisp
;;; Any .org file inside a zettel/ or zettels/ directory.
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/zettels?/[^/]+\\.org\\'" . zettel-mode))

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/home/USER/my-zettelkasten/[^/]+\\.org\\'" . zettel-mode))
```

To prevent `zettel-mode` from associating with the Deft files, eval
`(setq zettel-mode-no-deft t)` before loading `zettel-mode`.

SCRIPTS
-------

In the `scripts/` directory reside some helper scripts for common
maintenance tasks for the notes.  In general they work but they
probably don't handle all the corner cases (like filenames with
special characters).  Each script has a brief description included as
a comment.

FAQ
---

Q: Why it's not on MELPA?

A: I don't want to hoard such a generic name as `zettel-mode` and for
now I don't have a better name for it either.
